ðŸŒ± Life Goals
Welcome to a personal repositoryâ€”this is not about code, but about purpose.

ðŸŽ¯ Mission
To live a life that merges creative expression with critical thinkingâ€”where design isnâ€™t just beautiful, but meaningful, and research isnâ€™t just data, but a path to deeper understanding.

ðŸ§­ Core Goals
1. Design with Purpose
Use design to make information clearer, emotions more tangible, and stories more memorable. Strive to build things that help people feel, think, and act with intention.

2. Pursue Lifelong Curiosity
Stay endlessly curiousâ€”about people, systems, cultures, and technologies. Continue learning and evolving as both a creative and an analyst.

3. Bridge Art and Insight
Blend creative work with analytical depth. Whether through a beautifully designed interface or a well-structured research report, the goal is always clarity, empathy, and impact.

4. Make a Positive Impact
Contribute to projects and communities that aim to make the world more inclusive, informed, and inspired.

5. Build with Integrity
Work with authenticity and honesty. Let values guide choices, whether in career, collaboration, or creation.

âœ¨ Why This Repo?
We all have code that runs our lifeâ€”a set of principles, dreams, and motivations. This is mine, documented not in functions or commits, but in vision.
